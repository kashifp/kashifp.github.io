# Portfolio

This is my personal website including a portfolio with some of my work.
It was made using HTML, CSS, and some Javascript that came along with Bootstrap.

In addition to the portfolio, there currently is a folder 'notebooks' for data science notebooks meant to contain the Jupyter Notebook files converted to HTML for easy access to view the notebooks. I intend to house more html files there for future notebooks.
